📌 Introduction
This project showcases an interactive Excel dashboard built to analyze and communicate sales performance insights for a retail superstore between January 2023 and December 2024. The dashboard enables business leaders to make data-driven decisions by providing a real-time snapshot of key sales metrics.

🧭 Overview
The dashboard focuses on several key areas:

The goal was to consolidate this data into a single view for quick and effective decision-making.
